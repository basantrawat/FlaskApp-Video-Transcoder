# Flask App - Video Transcoder

This Flask App is more than just a Video Transcoder. It can be used to convert video from nearly any format to any other, resize video dimensions, cut a clip out of any video file, merge video files, and mirror the original video in x or y axis. All these operations can be performed in bulk by selecting multiple video files.
